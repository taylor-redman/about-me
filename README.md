# about-me
Taylor Redman is a freshman at Allegheny College and is planning on majoring in Computer Science with a double minor in Astronomy and History. He is very excited for the next three and a half years at Allegheny and is looking forward to meeting new people and making lifelong memories.
Taylor was born in Buffalo, NY and lived there his entire life before coming to Meadville, PA. He is a lifelong Bills and Sabres fan even though they provide their fans with more pain and suffering than they do wins. Some of his hobbies include playing saxophone. He played soprano, alto and tenor throughout high school and currently plays tenor for the Allegheny Wind Symphony and Wind Ensemble. He also used to play for the Allegheny Club Ice Hockey team until concussions forced him to stop playing. He now fills in as coach for the team.
